3.write out the truth tables of each boolean opeartor (that is ,every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they valuate to )?
A:
  truth table for 'and' operation
   T and T  = T
   T and F  = F
   F and T  = F
   F and F  = F
  truth table for 'or' operation
   T or T = T
   T or F = T
   F or T = T
   F or F = F
  truth table for not operation
   not T = F
   not F = T
